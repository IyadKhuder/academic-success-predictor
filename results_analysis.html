Conclusion: XGBoost is ~66√ó faster.

üß† Why XGBoost Outperformed CatBoost Despite Expectations
Initially, CatBoost was assumed to be more suitable for this dataset because:

Many features are categorical in nature, despite being encoded as numeric (int64, float64).

Example: course_code, education_level, etc. are numeric but represent categories.

However, XGBoost still outperformed CatBoost both in:

Classification accuracy

Model training speed

This can be attributed to:

Effective Greedy Splitting: Even if splits like feature < threshold are semantically meaningless, they may still capture useful patterns in large datasets.

Noise Tolerance: XGBoost handles numerically encoded categories well, even without explicitly recognizing them as categorical.

Strong Optimization: XGBoost‚Äôs highly optimized tree-building mechanism takes advantage of data scale and performs fast, greedy splits that can lead to strong performance even in non-ideal encoding scenarios.

‚úÖ Summary
Although CatBoost theoretically handles categorical variables better, XGBoost clearly outperformed in this project due to:

Higher precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes.

Much faster training time.

Robust performance even with categoricals encoded as numeric values.
